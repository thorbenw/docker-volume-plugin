Example Docker Volume Plugin
============================

This is another example driver like others present on
[GitHub](https://github.com).

# Basic features
- Version 2.0 Docker plugin
- No 3rd party package dependencies
- Supports volume processes, i.e. for each volume, a process can be maintained
  (e.g. started on volume creation, restarted on crash and terminated on volume
  removal.)
